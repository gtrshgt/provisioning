beaming happily 

(worried:1.2)

staring with crazy eyes

(in fear, scared)

with a radiant smile, eyes sparkling with genuine happiness,

with a contemplative look, gazing into the distance with furrowed brows,

expressing surprise, mouth slightly open and eyes wide with astonishment,

showing deep sadness, tears welling up and a sorrowful expression,

radiating confidence, standing tall with a determined gaze,

with a serene expression, eyes closed and face relaxed in peaceful contentment,

displaying anger, brows knitted and lips pressed into a thin line,

laughing heartily, eyes crinkled and mouth wide open,

with a look of confusion, head tilted and eyebrows raised in puzzlement,

showing fear, eyes wide and mouth slightly open in a gasp,

with a tender smile, eyes soft and face gentle with affection,

displaying intense focus, eyes narrowed and lips slightly pursed,

with an excited expression, eyes bright and a wide grin,

with a look of disappointment, eyes downcast and lips pressed together,

showing shyness, a slight smile and eyes looking away,

radiating pride, chin lifted and a slight smile of satisfaction,

with a wistful expression, eyes distant and lips softly curved,

displaying skepticism, one eyebrow raised and a slight frown,

showing relief, eyes closed and a gentle smile,

with a blank expression, eyes unfocused and face devoid of emotion,
